Itâ€™s an app allowing users to build their own 3D cartoonic miniature, constructed
by simple geometries, which each one represents one personality(e.g. tolerant, stern, lazy etc).
The user can share the miniature with others. Their friends can create their version of the user, and can choose to be public or unidentified. Sort of a interesting way to play with Johari window, exploring way to help people better understand their relationship with self and others.
